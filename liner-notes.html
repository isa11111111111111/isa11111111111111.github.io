    Lyrics: <br> <br>
    <i>
    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br>
    You and I <br>
    Are forever fleeting <br> <br>

    I think the heat's getting to me <br>
    Start to replay all of our memories <br>
    I feel the heat's getting to me <br> <br>

    Nostalgia eats me up <br>
    Up <br> <br>

    It's been seven months <br>
    Since your mind has been made up <br>
    See you in supercuts <br>
    The floor keeps rising up <br>
    You still resent me <br>
    For all I ever was <br> <br>

    Nostalgia eats me up <br>
    Up <br> <br>

    Up <br> <br>

    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br>
    You and I <br>
    Are forever fleeting <br> <br>

    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving 
</i>
