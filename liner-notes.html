    Lyrics: <br> <br>
    <i>
        Have you made up your mind yet <br> 
        Falling into you <br> 
        I'll do whatever you want to <br>
        Promise we'll stay the same <br> 
        Do whatever it takes <br> 
        Come up with whatever to say <br> 
        Would you wanna hear <br> <br> 

        Can you feel it <br> 
        Standing at the edge of the door <br> <br> 

        Can you hold it there <br> 
        We found it <br> 
        But baby could you go <br> 
        Without it <br> 
        And if you wanna know <br> 
        About me <br> 
        Then drink it all <br> 
        Surround me <br> <br> 

        Can you feel it <br> 
        Standing at the edge of the door <br> <br> 

        Can you feel it <br> <br> 

        Can you hold it there <br> 
        We found it <br> 
        But baby could you go <br> 
        Without it <br> 
        And if you wanna know <br> 
        About me <br> 
        Then drink it all <br> 
        Surround me <br> <br>

    Lyrics: <br> <br>
    <i>
    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br>
    You and I <br>
    Are forever fleeting <br> <br>

    I think the heat's getting to me <br>
    Start to replay all of our memories <br>
    I feel the heat's getting to me <br> <br>

    Nostalgia eats me up <br>
    Up <br> <br>

    It's been seven months <br>
    Since your mind has been made up <br>
    See you in supercuts <br>
    The floor keeps rising up <br>
    You start resenting me <br>
    For all I ever was <br> <br>

    Nostalgia eats me up <br>
    Up <br> <br>

    Up <br> <br>

    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br>
    You and I <br>
    Are forever fleeting <br> <br>

    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br> <br>
